        <h2>Establishing a secure channel</h2>
        <p>
        In the standard mental model of interaction with a smart contract, the
        contract is identified by the address it is deployed on chain. A client
        can validate that it is interacting with the expected contract by
        checking what's deployed at that location, and making sure the code of
        the contract meets expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
        In confidential contracts, an additional step is needed - the client
        must determine the public key with which to encrypt messages to the
        contract. This key is dynamic - it may change over time - meaning that
        a request for the current public key, and associated validation, is
        nessicary at the beginning of each session.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current encryption key for a confidential contract can be
        retrieved by calling <code>eth_getPublicKey</code> for the contract
        address.
