# Looking for Help?

We are huge fans of github for transparent, community-centered discussions. If you're having a problem,
search to see if a discussion of the issue already exists. If it does not, please file a new issue!

Times github might not be appropriate:

* The issue centers on your private code
  * Try to generalize to a test case you're able to share demonstrating the problem.
  * Contact us privately, although we can't guarantee responsiveness.
* The issue has security implications
  * please email our security@ point of contact.
